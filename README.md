> ðŸ’» Simplistic, minimalist and interactive personal website built with
> [`React`](https://reactjs.org/).

This website's design is both simple and accessible. Dynamic particles create an experience that is interactive and visually inviting. The site offers two themes via a toggle, dark mode (default) and light mode. Once toggled, the selected theme should persist between tabs, windows, and page reloads.
The website is mobile friendly.

Hosted using `gh-pages` and can be found @ [mtereshchuk.com](https://www.mtereshchuk.com)
